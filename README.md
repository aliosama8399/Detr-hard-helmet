## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Vision Transformer (ViT) for safety helmet detection. The model is designed to identify whether a person in an image is wearing a safety helmet or not. This has significant applications in workplace safety and compliance.

## Dataset

The safety helmet detection dataset used in this project includes labeled images of individuals in various scenarios, with annotations indicating whether a safety helmet is present or not. You can find the dataset [here](link-to-dataset).

## Model Architecture

The implemented Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture follows the principles of DETR (DEtection TRansformers) to perform object detection efficiently. The model is trained to detect the presence or absence of safety helmets in images.

For detailed information about the model architecture, please refer to the source code.


## Results

Include any relevant results, performance metrics, or visualizations obtained during training and evaluation.
